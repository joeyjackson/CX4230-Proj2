By default the simulation does not render the street visualization in console.

To enable the visualization renderings, uncomment lines 28 and 29 in main.py:
```
            # if (t * dt % 1 == 0):
            #     print(peachtree)
```


The simulation shows a stream of cars moving along Peachtree
