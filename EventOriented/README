Important files in this folder:
main.py --> contains code that matches the event-oriented world view
engine.py --> contains the classes including Event, FutureEventList, Vehicle, World
            also contains the EventHandler function
constants.py --> contains signal timing data and max sizes of the queues

Other files:
data.py, data_helper, data_vars, data_classes
    --> used for NGSIM data analysis
Given files:
signalTiming.xls --> stoplight signals of 10th to 14th intersection of Peachtree St NE
trajectories-0400pm-0415pm_editted.csv --> 15 minute vehicle data

How to run program: python main.py
Sample output (small part of actual output). "Now" represents time from 0 to 900 seconds
and below it is the road network with number of vehicles in each queue. Simulation averages
and number of vehicles travelled in each simulation are printed. Lastly,
the 95% confidence interval showing mean, lower bound, and upper bound is shown.
